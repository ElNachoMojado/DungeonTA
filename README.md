# DungeonTA
Mini text adventure in Ruby. To build it I followed along Chapter 6 of the book <em>Beginning Ruby 3</em> by Carleton DiLeo and Peter Cooper. This project is intended to get the readers used to building stuff the <em>Ruby way</em> and to solidify on the concepts of classes, objects, and modules which are introduced within the same chapter.
